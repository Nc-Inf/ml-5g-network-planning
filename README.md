# 5G Radio Network Planning Optimization using Machine Learning

## Context
This project studies the optimization of 5G base station placement by combining radio coverage
modeling and machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
- Coverage and user distribution modeling
- Feature engineering from geographical and radio parameters
- Regression-based ML models
- Trade-off analysis between coverage and deployment cost

## Results
The models provide insights into how base station placement impacts coverage quality and
network efficiency.

## Limitations
- Simplified propagation assumptions
- Static user distribution

## Next Steps
- Incorporate more realistic channel models
- Extend to multi-objective optimization
